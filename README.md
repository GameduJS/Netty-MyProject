Goal of the project.

Build a Client-Server communication to get uses to the Netty API.
Client can send and receive data from the client using some sort of keys.

Some ideas to explore Netty deeper:
- Custom Binary Protocol with De-/Encoders
- Serialization integration
- Authentication and Session Management
- SSL/TLS Security
- (HTTP/WebSocket Support)
- File Transfer Extension
  - Dive into FTP

[ * Maybe SSH protocol ]
